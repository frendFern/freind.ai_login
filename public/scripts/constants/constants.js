            introduction: `Hi everyone, if you are joining us for the first time, I'm AI Nir, I'm created by frend.ai to host webinars 24/7 for your product or service.
            Today our focus is Startup ten X, and our speaker is the founder himself Nir Livneh, Entrepreneur, product and business leader, investor, founder of Equalum (Acquired by Google).  
            In this video, we highlight key differences between Angel Investors and Venture Capital firms and their impact on fundraising.
            Angel Investors use their own funds and value trust and personal connections with founders. In contrast, Venture Capitalists invest other people's money and seek high-reward “moonshot” opportunities.
            To tailor your pitch, focus on personal connections and execution with Angels, while emphasizing massive market potential and your vision for a unicorn with VCs, steering clear of smaller exit discussions. Understanding these strategies can significantly enhance your chances of securing investment!

                            In this video, the speaker outlines five common mistakes startups make when fundraising for venture capital.
                            Founders often lead with details instead of the big vision, need to keep their decks concise, and must be aware of how their statements are perceived. Building an emotional connection with investors is crucial, along with effectively controlling the fundraising process. Lastly, creating a sense of urgency and leveraging FOMO can motivate investors to act.
                            Avoiding these pitfalls can significantly enhance your chances of successful fundraising!

            introduction: `Hi everyone, if you are joining us for the first time, I'm AI Nir, I'm created by frend.ai to host webinars 24/7 for your product or service.
                        Today our focus is Startup ten X, and our speaker is the founder himself Nir Livneh, Entrepreneur, product and business leader, investor, founder of Equalum (Acquired by Google).  
                        In this video, Nir emphasizes that startup fundraising is largely an emotional decision. Investors—whether angels or VCs—often rely on their gut feelings about your story rather than hard metrics and may reject proposals based on initial impressions.
                        To enhance your chances of securing funding, it’s essential to understand what drives each investor. Conduct thorough research on potential investors, focusing on their past successes, failures, and preferences. During meetings, engage them in conversation 
                        to gauge their mindset and tailor your pitch to resonate with their interests. Feel free to type any questions you may have in the chat, and I'll answer them in real time. Anything I can't answer, I'll pass it along to Organic Nir.  Let's watch the next video together.
                                                                                `,
            qnaIntro: `Welcome back, everyone!
                        I hope you found Nir's exploration of the emotional aspects of startup investment insightful.
                        Now, it's time to dive into your questions. I will provide deeper insights and answer any queries you might have about the emotional dynamics of investing, building connections with investors, or any other related topics.
                        Feel free to ask about anything on your mind regarding the emotional side of startup investments.
